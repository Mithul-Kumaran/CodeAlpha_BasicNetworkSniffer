# CodeAlpha_BasicNetworkSniffer
This Python program is a real-time packet sniffer and analyzer built using the powerful scapy library. It captures network traffic directly from your systemâ€™s interface and displays detailed information about each packet, helping you learn how data flows through the network and understand core protocols like IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
